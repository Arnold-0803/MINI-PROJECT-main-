INTRODUCTION 

To begin with, there is use to discover our potential to go beyond our native culture for poor agricultural practices with respect to business community and economy, therefore there is need to come up with better mechanisms whereby we can attract players such as landlords whose land is not in a proper use/neglected and would be willing to collaborate with other stakeholders on a contract that is guided by the terms and conditions to produce agricultural produce such as food and cash crops, raw materials to the industries and organic manure just to mention few. 

All these would be possible through online platform (e-commerce platform), moreover the developed website platform  will connect different parties be it landlords or enthusiastic agricultural investors and will give them both opportunity to show case their resources, that is, landlords will produce the attributes of their land and details of land will as well include characteristics of piece of land by topography, climate, soil structure and so on. Like has been stipulated, the investors on the hand will be able to advertise their product to the trader/customers.
